            <h1>Distinct influences in Malaysia</h1>
            <p>The country is made up of an ethnic split of Malays (53%), 
                Chinese (20%) and Indian (6%) but also contains smaller 
                numbers of Thai, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Cambodian ethnicities. These distinct influences play 
                their own parts.

                    <h3>1. Chinese influences in Malaysian food</h3>
                    <p>Chinese influences in Malaysian food tend to be very eclectic but like Indian food, represents cooking
                         traditions of the southern Chinese regions where most immigration came from. Therefore, you’ll find
                          more Cantonese and Fujian influences in Malaysian food as opposed to the Shandong style of cooking,
                           for example. Using noodles, bean sprouts, tofu and soy sauce are commonly used in popular Malaysian 
                           dishes like curry laksa, curry mee and a variety of ‘Nyonya‘ (ethnic mix of Chinese and local Malay)
                            dishes which comprise a Chinese origin with a Malaysian influence.</p>

                    <h3>2. Indian influences in Malaysian food</h3>
                    <p>We see a lot of Indian influence in Malaysian cooking by the way of thick curry sauces made by frying
                         spices as found in mutton and dhal curry dishes. Historically most Indian immigration into Malaysia came
                          from south India and dishes like banana leaf curry, rice, pickled vegetables and fruit are evidence of 
                          such south Indian influences. The cow is considered sacred amongst India’s Hindu population and so it’s 
                          common to see more vegetable or fish-based dishes as part of the Indian influence. Ingredients like okra 
                          and purple eggplants, brown mustard, fenugreek and curry leaves are typical south-Indian mainstays in 
                          Malaysian cooking. However, the biggest influences from the south Indian community in Malaysian food is 
                          the use of bread (or roti) like paratha, chapati and naan which are used to dip in curry and sauces as an 
                          accompaniment.</p>

                    <h3>3. Malay influences in Malaysian food</h3>
                    <p>At the heart of Malaysian food is the cooking traditions of the ethnic Malays who make up the majority of 
                        Malaysian society. Ethnic Malay food is steeped in tradition and has been influenced by neighbouring island 
                        countries in all directions including Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore. In the 15th century, the Malay 
                        peninsula became a spice trading hub where merchants from all over the east and even Europe would come to trade. 
                        Ethnic Malay food can vary depending on the region. For instance, northern dishes like Nessi Lemak comprise coconut
                         cream, rice, cucumber and fish, and are generally lighter. In southern regions like Negeri Sembilan, dishes like 
                         beef rendang tend to be more rich, thick and heavy.</p>

              <h1>Street Food Culture in Malaysia</h1>
              <p>The social aspect of dining is a huge part of Malaysian culture and in big cities like Kuala Lumpur or Penang, street 
                food is an especially mouth-watering spectacle. Eating culture is very much a 24 hour a day pattern where food outlets 
                serve up tasty quick dishes for a reasonable price, with Indian Mamaks making up the later hour offerings with their near 
                24-hour service. The open-air street food culture is so popular in Malaysia because it allows Malaysians to have a choice 
                of eating what they want and when they want.</p>

                        <h5>Hawker Stalls</h5>
                        <p>The Hawker centre is a collection of Hawker stalls set up in a food court-like arrangement. The centres usually 
                            have a selection of different stalls similar to a market but with a central seating area where diners can sit 
                            and enjoy their meals. Music from live bands is sometimes included as a part of a Malaysian hawker centre and 
                            this creates a fun and ambient atmosphere. What makes Hawker stands so unique is that you can pick out a 
                            selection of dishes from multiple stands and create a banquet-style fest. This is especially great if you are 
                            with a group of people.</p>

                        <h5>Mamaks</h5>
                        <p>Mamak’s are a uniquely Malaysian fixture and can be found on the streets of most big Malaysian cities. These 
                            small stalls are a place for people to congregate, chat and socialise whilst enjoaying a drink or something 
                            to eat. Roti Canai with dhal, Nasi Lemak and Mee Goreng are some of the commonly served Mamak style snacks 
                            along with coffee, milo, Teh Tarik and other soft drinks. In fact, at PA Food we created a special Roti Canai 
                            in the authentic Mamak style. Very much part of the Malaysian nightlife scene, Mamak stalls are open around the 
                            clock and provide small plastic tables and chairs for patrons to use.</p>

                        <h5>Night Markets</h5>
                        <p>Night markets are a common occurrence around Malaysia partly spurred by the yearly night food festivities around
                             the holy month of Ramadan. Besides Malaysians generally prefer to go out after sunset when it’s cooler. At these 
                             markets, you can expect to find a wider array of food options on display from all around south-east Asia.</p>
